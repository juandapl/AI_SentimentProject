It is possible that expanding slang obscured the general meaning of the sentences, or that emojis were given too much weight, or that our simple approach to negation (which in some cases such as `tweets[0]`: \"not that the dx is cool\" is part of a syntactical formula, not a negation per se) might have affected some scores. As well, it is possible that sentence-wise, and not word-wise averaging might have given extra weight to nuances that could mislead our rules."
